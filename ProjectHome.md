I have tried many to-do & task list solutions out there. But have found them all to be overly complicated, abstracted or metaphorized. This Task Thing is simple. With the focus on the tasks themselves, I have tried to eliminate any sort of interface while retaining some useful features.

## Features ##
  * Inline editing, just double click
  * Drag & drop ordering
  * One click to add a new task
  * One click to mark a task done
  * One click to delete a task

Coded in Python and jQuery.
